Libre Graphics Community Print Shoppe dev for Mozilla Open Leads

Libre Graphics Community Print Shoppe is a community owned and run cooperative maker space for digital skill development and Free software based visual communication in Hackney. Its mission is to change homogeneous creative industries culture and diversify range of digital tools for visual communication through a community-led cultural project. A model that can be replicated, using a successful example such as Access Space, Libre Graphics Community Print Shoppe is a self-organised, self-governed creative practice in the tradition of artist-run spaces of London East End and socially embedded art practice.

+ Micro hackspace that promotes Free software culture and practice.

+ Totally hypothetical at the moment.

Here you will find a collection of documents created during Mozilla Open Leaders (Cohort 6) that help develop and articulate this idea.
